TSharkThreading v1:
No threading, the red backgroundis set at setup, and set to green at draw. However, you will note the sketch doesnt turn green for a few seconds as the sketch needs to wait for the powershell process to end.
Note that this won't work on mac as it implements the Windows powershell and my personal PC's file Paths.
TSharkThreading v2:
Threads make this script much more viable : )

Textdump.pde is my most visually appealing in my opinion.
